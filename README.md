# PersonalMetricsConverter

This Python code performs two main functions. First, it collects personal input by asking for the user's name, then calculates and displays a bill amount by taking the subtotal and gratuity rate as inputs, factoring in tax to determine the grand total. Second, it converts weight from pounds to kilograms, grams, and milligrams. The program's versatility lies in its ability to handle both personal data display and metric conversions, making it useful for tasks involving calculations related to bills and weight measurements.
